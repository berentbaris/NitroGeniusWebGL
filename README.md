# NitroGeniusWebGL

Nitrogenius 2 was constructed as a free and open-source web application using a game engine called Unity developed by Unity Technologies. This WebGL folder is produced through the build WebGL function available in Unity. The Build WebGL function in Unity is used to compile and package the Unity project so that it can run in a web browser using WebGL technology. WebGL (Web Graphics Library) allows rendering 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible browser without needing plugins. The WebGL file enables the game to be hosted on GitHub pages at https://berentbaris.github.io/NitroGeniusWebGL/. The Dutch version of the game can be accessed at https://berentbaris.github.io/NitrogeniusWebGL-Dutch/. All game files including the source code are uploaded to GitHub and is accessible to and editable by the public (https://github.com/berentbaris/NitroGenius-public). These full files can be imported into Unity as a project and then the build WebGL function in Unity can be used to produce the WebGL files found in this repository.
